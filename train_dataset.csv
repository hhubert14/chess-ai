The best move is d7d5 and the evaluation is 14. Explain why d7d5 is the best move.","If White strikes first with the advance of his d-pawn, then Black is able to equalize with 8.d4 cxd4 9.Qxd4 Nc6 10.Qd2 d5 11.cxd5 Qxd5, for example 12.Nd4 Ne4! 13.Nxc6 Qxc6 14.Bxg7 Kxg7 15.Qe3 Qc5 16.Qxc5 Nxc5 17.Bxb7 Nxb7 18.Nc3 Rac8 19.Rac1 Rfd8, is completely equal, Barcza-Steiner, Budapest 1948. If we compare this situation to the one that occurs in the line after 8.Nc3 d5, we note that here Black has completed his development and is able to challenge White on the c- and d-files with his rooks."

White has a small nagging initiative for the endgame in that:
a) his knight is ACTIVE and CENTRALIZED, while Black's knight is still at home (indeed, it is not clear where Black should develop his knight);
b) White's rooks are already CONNECTED;
c) White has the maneuver Nd4-b5 in reserve to create pressure against Black's queenside pawns and interfere with Black's development."

B2) 17...Kf6 18.Nb5 Rxc1 19.Rxc1 Nc5 20.b4, with an edge for White, Ribli-Sapi, Budapest 1976. These examples show how White's Nd4-b5 idea can make life awkward for Black.

A) 17...Kf6 18.Nb5 Rxc1 (18...Nc5? - losing a pawn - 19.b4 Ne6 20.Rxc8 Rxc8 21.Nxa7, with a big advantage for White, Smyslov-Castro Rojas, Biel 1976) 19.Rxc1 Nc5 20.b4 Ne6 21.Rc6, reaches a position that occurred in the game Portisch-Pachman, Sarajevo 1963, when White stood better.

Beliavsky recommends the plan with queenside castling (see his notes to Game 23). Recently, a couple of important games concerning this theme were played:
Khalifman-Epishin (Dos Hermanas 1993): 10...Qc7 11.Bd2 b6 12.Qg4 Kf8 13.0-0-0 Bb7 14.Rhe1 Rd8 15.Kb1 (not 15.Rxe6 fxe6 16.Nh4 Nf6 17.Qxe6 Qf7!; 15.c4 c5 16.Bc3?! Nf6 17.Qh4 Bxf3 18.gxf3 Bf4+ also gives white nothing.) 15...Nf6 16.Qh4 (no better is 18.Ng4 or 18.Bc3) 16...cxd4 19.g4 (19.Re2 with the initiative is correct) 19...g5 20.Qf2 (20.fxg6 hxg6 21.Qg3 Rhg8 favors black), and now after 20...Rhe8 21.h3 a5?! 22.Re2 Nd5 23.Rde1 Ne3 24.Bxe3 dxe3 25.Qxe3 Qc5 and the players agreed to a draw in an unclear position. They had little time left. Instead of 21...a5?!, 21...Nd5!? gave black a noticeable advantage.
Sion Castro-Karpov (Leon 1993): 12...g5! (an important improvement over 12...Kf8) 13.Qh3 Rg8! 14.g4 (after 14.Qh6 Bf8 15.Qh7 Nf6! 16.Qh3 g4 17.Qh4 gxf3 18.Qxf6 fxg2, white maintains equality with 19.Rg1 Qh2 20.0-0-0; 14.Bh7 Rh8 15.Bd3 is also equal) 14...Bb7 15.0-0-0 0-0-0 16.Rhe1 Bf4 17.Kb1 Rh8 18.Bc3 (18.Bxf4 Qxf4 19.Qg3 Qxg3 20.hxg3 c5 is equal) 18...Kb8 19.d5 cxd5 20.Bxh8 Rxh8 21.Nd4 a6 22.Ne6 (if 22.Qf1, 22...Nc5 is strong) 22..fxe6 23.Rxe6 Ne5! 24.Bf5 Nc4 25.Rxh6 Rxh6 26.Qxh6 Qe5 27.Qf8+ Ka7 28.Qb4 Nd2+, and black won quickly."

annotated by Beliavsky (Game 23).
On 11.Qh4, theory indicates 11...Nd5, but after 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.c3,white has a small positional advantage, and more importantly, black has little play.
After 11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 Qh5 13.Qxh5 Nxh5 14.Ne5! 0-0 15.0-0-0, black also does not have enough counterplay (Hector-Hodgson, London 1991): 15...c5 (better is 15...Nf6) 16.g4 Nf6 17.g5! hxg5 18.Bxg5 Nd5 (if 18...cxd4 19.Bxf6 gxf6 20.Rdg1+ Kh8 21.Rg3! Be5 22.Rh3+ and Rg1+) 19.Nc4 Bc7 20.dxc5, with a noticeable white advantage.
Of course, 11...0-0 is bad because of the standard 12.Bxh6! gxh6 13.Qxh6, after which black will not survive; 14.Ng5 is enough of a threat."

I was afraid of the queen shift to the kingside. The exchange of queens seemed to me to be a dull idea. It took me a long time before I found the correct decision. And so this important novelty remained a secret for five years!
The idea of the king move is that black unexpectedly harmonizes the placement of his pieces, which were a bit out of sync only a move ago. But now the threat is g7-g5-g4, winning a piece. If white wants to maintain the opening advantage, he must act decisively."

The best move is b3b7 and the evaluation is 24. Explain why b3b7 is the best move.","Here, black was at a crossroads. He prefers, in this game, the most popular continuation - a forced transition into the endgame. A sharp middlegame, but with a certain risk for black, awaits him after 9...Nb6 10.d5. It is easier for black to defend after 10.Be3 e6 11.0-0-0 Be7 12.d5 exd5 13.Bxb6 Qxb6 14.Qxb6 axb6 15.Nxd5 Rxa2 16.Kb1 Ra5! with an equal endgame.

After 10.d5 Nd4 11.Qd1 e5 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Be3 Bc5, we arrive at the extremely sharp position shown in the analysis The practice of the last several years shows that black can maintain equality. Here are several examples: 1) 14.Bg2 Qh4 15.0-0 Bd6 16.h3 Nf5 17.Qb3 0-0 18.Qxe6+ Kh8 19.Qe4 Qf6 20.Qg4 Qf7 and black has sufficient compensation for the pawn (Malaniuk-Yudasin, USSR Championship, Moscow 1991), or 2) 14.b4 0-0 15.bxc5 Nxf3+ 16.Ke2 Qf6 17.cxb6 (17.Bg2?! Nc4! is in black's favor) 17...Rad8 18.Qc2 Nd4+ 19.Bxd4 Qxd4 20.Ne4 Qxa1 21.Bg2 Qe5 with mutual chances (Hansen,L-Kuijf, Graested 1990)."

The b-file opens up, and the white rook puts it to good use. Black, meanwhile, experiences difficulty in completing his kingside development.
The game Fischer-Euwe (Leipzig Olympiad 1960) serves as an excellent illustration of white's play in an ending of this type: 14...Qd7 15.Rb1! Rd8?! (more tenacious is 15...Qxb5 16.Rxb5 Kd6, although after 17.Rb7 the rook is boss on the seventh rank) 16.Be3 Qxb5 17.Rxb5 Rd7 18.Ke2 f6 19.Rd1! Rxd1 20.Kxd1 Kd7 21.Rb8 Kc6 22.Bxa7 g5 23.a4, and the extra passed pawn decided the fate of the game.
14...f6 looks stronger, preparing the evacuation of the king: 15.Qb7+ Ke8 16.Rb1 Qc8! is not dangerous, as black plays Kf7 next. If white plays the obvious 15.Ba3+ Kf7 16.Rd1 Qc8 17.Rd7+ Kg8, the king hides from the threats after h7-h5."

By following the main line of development with 17...Ke6! black keeps the game level. For instance, 18.0-0-0 Bb4 19.a3 Rhc8+ 20.Kb1 Bc5 21.Rhe1 Bxe3 22.Rxe3+ Kd6 23.Rde1 Rc4, and the weakness of the h2 pawn is felt (Belikov-Dreev, Moscow 1992).

The best move is e1g1 and the evaluation is 9. Explain why e1g1 is the best move.","After a brief opening shootout, the game has been transformed into an endgame with the isolani on d5. The true evaluation of this position determines how secure the entire plan with 5...Nc6 is, because modern theory considers this position the optimal achievement for white in this variation. The presence of the doubled pawns on the f-file is compensated by the possibility to attack the weak pawns d5 and a7 in black's position.
Obviously, the key freeing maneuver for black is Ke7-e6 with the development of the bishop. But this takes time. The evaluation of this endgame depends upon how white can utilize this time. Jumping ahead a bit, I can say that I was able to make something out of my chances, although often black manages to hold this position."

The best move is e7e6 and the evaluation is 9. Explain why e7e6 is the best move.","The queenside castling plan is considered most critical: 16.Be3 Ke6 17.0-0-0, and now white immediately hits the a7 and d5 pawns. But the open position of the king allows black to make his pieces cooperate well if he defends accurately.
Here are several possibilities: 1) 17...Rc8+ 18.Kb1 Bc5 19.Rhe1 Kd6 20.Bf4+ Kc6 21.Re2 Rhd8; 16.Bf4 Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and black protects everything (J.Polgar-De Jong, Wijk aan Zee 1990), or 2) 17...Bb4 (stopping the check from e1) 18.Kb1 (or 18.a3 Rhc8+ 19.Kb1 Bc5) 18...Rhd8 19.Rd3 Rd7 20.Rc1 Rb8 21.Rc6+ Kf5 22.Ra6 (the pin 22.Rb3 is parried tactically: 22...d4! 23.Bd2 Bxd2 24.Rxb8 d3 25.Rc4 Bh6, and the passed pawn ties down white after d3-d2) 22...Rbb7 23.a3 Be7 - black transfers the bishop to f6, from where it controls the blockading square d4. This is an important factor in the defense of positions like this, with the isolated pawn. Black keeps the equal chances (Brunner-Adorjan, Germany 1990). If white tries 16.Bf4, in order to keep the black king from d6, the black king goes to f5 with tempo. For example, 16...Ke6 17.0-0-0 Bb4 18.a3 Rac8+ 19.Kb1 Ba5 20.Rhg1 g6 21.b4 Bb6 22.Rge1+ Kf5, and all is well for black (Brunner-Stering, Luxembourg 1989)."
